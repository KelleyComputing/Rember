Please read &quot;COPYING&quot;       for more info.<br>      Instructions:<br>      To run this application, copy it to any folder on your hard drive (Applications,       Utilities, Desktop, etc.). When you open the program, you have two tabs       to select from: &quot;Rember&quot; and &quot;Log&quot;. The Rember tab will       let you select the number of test loops to perform, and the amount of memory       to test *. The Log tab will display the output of the &quot;memtest&quot;       process at run time.<br>      As of version 0.2b, there are Preferences that allow the user to quit all       running applications, and/or the Finder. This allows for more available       testing memory. There are now &quot;Verbose&quot; options in Preferences,       and the &quot;Log&quot; view. This will toggle an output filter, displaying       more/less output from memtest.<br>      Version 0.3b contains a 64-bit version of memtest, breaking memory testing       barriers that were present in past versions. It is also possible to stop       testing upon the detection of errors. Preferences are now saved in user       defaults.<br>      You do not need to install the memtest program for this application to work       (Rember includes memtest inside of its application bundle). If you would       like to run the memtest program from the command line (this also includes       single user mode), see the &quot;READMEFIRST&quot; file inside of the &quot;Memtest411.dmg&quot;       archive in the enclosing disk image. <br>      * Note that this application will only allocate as much free physical memory       as it can for testing. This will not run tests on all blocks of memory,       as all memory is not available when booted into the Finder. To do more thorough       tests, see the &quot;READMEFIRST&quot; file in the &quot;Memtest411.dmg&quot;       package. This describes how to run &quot;memtest&quot; in single user mode.<br>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>      <span class="version">Version Changes:<br>      v. 0.1b 9/3/2004 Initial beta release.<br>      v. 0.1.04b 9/5/2004 minor minor version change<br>      &#8226; Now uses spinning progressIndicator in main Nib file to lower the       amount of processor used by Rember application.<br>      &#8226; Uses updated version (4.04M) of memtest executable.<br>      v. 0.2.0b 9/10/2004 minor version change<br>      &#8226; total GUI overhaul. <br>      &#8226; Preferences added. <br>      &#8226; Verbose logging (filtering) function added<br>      &#8226; Test progress in status field<br>      &#8226; loop counter<br>      &#8226; application/Finder quit functions<br>      v. 0.2.1b 9/23/2004 minor minor version change<br>      &#8226; Preferences window is now a sheet<br>      &#8226; Save option for log details<br>      &#8226; Dock menu added<br>      &#8226; Icon added <br>      v 0.2.2b 12/4/2004 minor minor version change<br>      <br>      &#8226; Performance enhancements<br>      &#8226; Icon touch-up<br>      v 0.2.3b 1/25/2005 minor minor version change<br>      <br>      &#8226; Uses updated version (4.05M) of memtest executable<br>      - errors in memory testing are reported <br>      &#8226; Rember reports errors (Rember source unmodified)<br>      v.0.3b 8/18/2005 minor version change<br>      &#8226; Uses new version of memtest executable (4.11)<br>      &#8226; Added &quot;Continue on Error&quot; preference<br>      v.0.3.1b 12/22/2005<br>      <br>      &#8226; Uses updated version (4.12) of memtest executable<br>      &#8226; Now saves preferences with user defaults</span><br>      ---------<br>      Rember v0.3.1b<br>      www.kelleycomputing.net/rember</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
