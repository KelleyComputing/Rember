What does this mean, and what should I do?</p>      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Rember is an application &quot;wrapper&quot;         or GUI for a command line program. This program uses a command-line executable         called <a href="http://www.memtestosx.org" target="_blank">memtest</a>         (this is not developed by <a href="http://www.kelleycomputing.net">Kelley         Computing</a>). You can learn more about it by seeing the memtest bundle         included with Rember, or by clicking the memtest link above. </p>      <p>When this program reports failures, Rember only displays this in the         log window. Future versions will have the abilities to report failures,         but as of now (v.0.2.1) the failures will only be logged.</p>      <p><strong>Question (continued): </strong>That takes care of how to recognize         failures, but how do I take care of the problem?</p>      <p><strong>Answer: </strong>If you are not comfortable installing and un-installing         hardware in a computer, you should take it to a service technician for         diagnosis/repair. If you are comfortable with removing and replacing hardware,         the only way (I'm sorry) to locate defective memory chips is by guess         and check. This may be updated in the future. You may also attempt to         run the Apple Hardware Test CD or DVD that comes with most Macs. This         will give more information (if it finds the problem).</p>      <p><strong>Question: </strong>Why does Rember eat up so much of the processor's         available cycles sometimes, and not at others?</p>      <p><strong>Answer:</strong> When the memory tests are running, the Rember         program is continuously logging, and (if chosen) filtering &quot;garbage&quot;         information (eg. command line progress indicators). This cuts down on         processor and memory hogging by Rember. When using this program to test         very small amounts of memory (example: 1MB), it will not be efficient.         When using the &quot;All&quot; option, this is alleviated. Leaving the         &quot;Log&quot; tab selected seems to be the most efficient.</p>												</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
